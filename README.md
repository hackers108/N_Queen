# N_Queen
N_Queen_Problem #DSA #Backtracking 
This project aims to solve the N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial optimization challenge in chess. The problem requires placing N queens on an N Ã— N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no two queens should be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

The project utilizes backtracking to efficiently explore all possible placements and find valid solutions.
